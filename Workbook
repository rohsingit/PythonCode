4As 
  - Ask: What data? Whats the problem? Whats the hypothesis?
  - Acquire: Right data? Metadata, outliers, links, population size, plot samples, corelations
  - Analyze: What insights can we extract? 
  - Act: Turn the data for actions
  
  Data Storytelling - Narrative + Insights + Visuals
  
  4D Framework - 
    Discover: Guide the qualitative reserach and provide context
    Define: Quantify the opportunity
    Develop: Setup, run and measure experiments
    Deliver: Deploy/instrument solution

Signal Analysis (Using Python for real-time signal analysis (Mohammad Farhan)):
Hardware to PC through network, USB, API etc

[HARDWARE]  Gain -> Clean (filtering, downconversion, IQ modulation) -> Digitize (dessimiation, freq shifting, CRI/FIR filters) -> Send
[PC]        Clean (IQ offset, FFT, power spectrum) -> Visualize -> Complile (exe, csv, database) -> Signal

[READ]        PySerial, PyUSB, PyAudio, Sockets, C/C++ API
[CLEAN]       Numpy, Scipy
[VISIALIZE]   PySide (QT), PyQtGraph, MatplotLib
[COMPILER]    PyInstaller, xlwt, sql

Under Scipy:    Spectogram to visualize sound signals
                FFT spectrum
